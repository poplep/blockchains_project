      <span class="c8">A blockchain is a shared distributed ledger that allows for the recording of transactions and asset tracking on a network. An asset can be anything from  a house, a car, land, or even patents, copyrights, or branding. Anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network. This reduces the risk and cuts costs for anyone involved in the tracking process.</span>
      <span class="c36"> </span>
      <span class="c1">In terms of Bitcoin and the blockchain, think of the blockchain as the operating system and Bitcoin as the application that is running on the operating system. Bitcoin is only the first use case for the Blockchain [5].</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c13">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c1">Blockchains are a new and developing technology that may further protect against data breaches. They are defined as incorruptible digital ledgers of economic transactions that have the ability to be programmed to record everything of value. Blockchains have created the backbone of a new internet system by allowing the distribution of digital information but not allowing that digital information to be copied. [1]. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c3">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
      <span class="c1">They were originally devised for Bitcoin, the digital currency, but the technology community is finding other potential uses for them. Blockchains allow digital information to be distributed but not copied. Information shared on a blockchain exists as a shared and continually updated database. Information is public, easily verifiable, and is not stored in one single location. Therefore, it makes it extremely difficult for hackers to corrupt the data since no centralized version of this information exists. Since blockchains store blocks of information that are identical across the network, the blockchain can’t be controlled by one single entity and it has no single point of failure. Therefore, data breaches may be prevented by potentially storing user information or any other confidential information on a blockchain. A blockchain can be viewed as a spreadsheet that is duplicated across a network of computers that’s designed to regularly update this spreadsheet [1]. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c14">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
      <span class="c1">A verified piece of data forms a block that has to be added to the chain in order for a blockchain to be created. Blockchain users have to use their respective keys and computing systems to run algorithms that solve complex math problems. Once a problem is solved, the block is added to the chain and the data it contains exists on the network forever (can’t be altered or removed) [11]. In order to update data, the owner has to add a new block on top of the previous block which creates a specific chain of code. The entire chain across the network changes accordingly. Every single alteration is tracked and no data is lost/deleted because users can always look at previous version of the block to identify what’s different in the latest version [11].<br/>

      <span class="c1">Anything that happens on the blockchain network is a function of the network as a whole [1]. Therefore, the blockchain is managed by all nodes on its network instead of a single entity. Decentralization is defined as the networking operating on a user-to-user/peer-to-peer basis [1].</span>

    <p class="c2 c16">
      <span class="c1">Blockchains are defined as public ledgers of all transactions and communications that have ever been executed on the network [3]. They are comprised of a network of nodes that get a copy of the blockchain that is automatically downloaded once they join the blockchain network [1]. A block is the “current” part of the blockchain that records some or all of the recent communications [3]. Once the communication or transaction is completed, the block goes into the blockchain as a permanent database [3]. Once a block is completed, a new block is generated [3]. These blocks are linked together in the form of a chain in linear chronological order with every block containing a hash of its previous block [3]. </span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c2">
      <span class="c1">The concepts of parallel blockchains and sidechains allow for tradeoffs and improved scalability using independent blockchains which allow for further innovation [3]. Various benefits of blockchains include decentralization, recording and validating every transaction which provides security and reliability, authorization of transactions by miners which make the transactions immutable and prevent hacking threats, and they discard the need for third-party or central authority for P2P transactions [3]. Various companies and institutions are studying blockchains to apply them to various areas such as money transfers, risk management, smart bonds, and cryptocurrencies.</span>

The attack goes on until the site gets overwhelmed with requests and crashes [11]. The main difficulty in preventing DDoS is with the existing DNS (Domain Name System) [11].

By using blockchains to protect data, a system can ensure that it is invulnerable to hackers unless every node on the network is wiped clean simultaneously [11]. If current DNS would operate on the blockchain, users would still be able to register domain names but only authorized users could make changes to their domains [11].

Public Blockchains are permissionless, meaning that data is publically available to anyone who wishes to participate on the network [2]. Private Blockchains are permission based platforms established by groups or individual firms, or divisions within an organization. Data can only be accessed by those users who are part of the group and are properly authenticated [2]. Blockchains can help with digital identities and maintaining data integrity. They have the ability to improve cyber defense since they can secure and prevent fraudulent activities and detect data tampering based on their underlying characteristics of immutability, transparency, auditability, data encryption, and operational resilience [2].</span>

    <p class="c2">
      <span class="c1">The CIA triad represents confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality is defined as the property that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes [2]. The main concern of confidentiality is ensuring only interested and authorized parties can access the correct and appropriate data to them [2]. If an attacker can gain access to the blockchain network, then they are more likely to gain access to the data. Therefore, authentication and authorization controls need to be implemented [2]. Various blockchain implementations are starting to address data confidentiality and access control challenges by providing full block data encryption and AAA capabilities. [2]. Full encryption of blockchain data ensures that it won’t be accessed by unauthorized parties while this data is in transit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c14">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
      <span class="c1">With public blockchains, there’s no requirement to control network access since the chain protocols allow anyone to access and participate in the network [2]. Private blockchains require that appropriate security controls are in place to protect network access. Blockchains can provide advanced security controls: leveraging the public key infrastructure (PKI) to authenticate and authorize parties, and encrypt their communications [2]. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c14">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
      <span class="c1">Today, if an attacker gains access to the blockchain network and its data, this doesn’t always mean that the attacker can read or retrieve the information stored on the blockchain. Full encryption of data blocks can be applied to guarantee its confidentiality. End-to-End Encryption ensures that only those who have authorization to access the encrypted data i.e. through their private key can decrypt and see the data [2]. Using encryption keys along with PKI on a blockchain can provide higher levels of security. Implementing secure communication protocols on a blockchain guarantees that even when an attacker tries to do a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker won’t be able to either forge the interlocutor’s identity or disclose any data while in transit [2]. Accessing the blockchain from multiple devices using the same key can put the organization at a higher risk of losing control of their private keys. </span>

      <span class="c8">Integrity is defined as guarding against improper information modification or destruction. It includes ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity [2]. This may consist of data encryption, hash comparison, or digital signatures. Blockchains have built in immutability and traceability that provide means for data integrity.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c14">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
      <span class="c8">Blockchains are secure from the perspective that they enable users to trust that the transactions stored on them are valid [2]. Blockchains use sequential hashing and cryptography. They also have a decentralized structure. These 3 characteristics make it very challenging for any party to tamper with it compared to a standard database [2]. 51% of users need to agree a transaction is valid before it is added to the blockchain (consensus model protocol).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c14">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c2">
      <span class="c8">Blockchains guarantee that nothing will be erased. The solution to the “right to be forgotten” problem of integrity is to encrypt the personal information written in the system to ensure that forgetting the keys will ensure that the information is no longer accessible. Therefore, we should focus on blockchain’s value to provide unaltered evidence of facts by writing the hash of transactions to it, while the transactions themselves are stored outside of the system. This ensures integrity of transactions and enables the ability to erase transactions, leaving only small traces of forgotten information on the chain.</span>
      <span class="c8 c28"> </span>
      <span class="c1">Every transaction added to a blockchain (private or public) is digitally signed and timestamped. The organization can trace back to a specific time period for each transaction and identify the party (through their public address) on the blockchain [2]. Nonrepudiation is the assurance that someone can’t duplicate the authenticity of their signature on a file or the authorship on transaction that they originated [2]. It increases the reliability of the system (detection of tamper events or fraudulent transactions) since every transaction is cryptographically associated to a user. Any new transaction added to the blockchain will result in a change of the global state of the ledger. The implication is that with every new iteration of the system, the previous state of the system will be stored which results in a fully traceable history log [2]. This provides entities with an extra level of reassurance that data is authentic and hasn’t been tampered with.</span>

The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is the most common attack and can cause the most disruption to internet services as websites are disrupted and apps become unresponsive [2]. DDoS attacks on blockchain networks are costly since they attempt to overpower the network with large volumes of small transactions. The decentralization and peer-to-peer characteristics of the blockchain make it harder to disrupt than client-server architectures. Blockchains are also subject to DDoS attacks but they are able to withstand them a lot better than regular network architectures. Since Blockchains have no single point of failure, this decreases the chances of an IP-based DDoS attack disrupting normal operation. If a node is taken down, data is still accessible via other nodes on the network since they all have a full copy of the blockchain at all times [2]. Bitcoin has withstood cyber-attacks for more than 7 years.  Organizations can still face risks from external events outside of their control despite using blockchains (i.e. global internet outage) [2]. Blockchains have operational resistance due to their combination of peer-to-peer nature and number of nodes on the network, operating in a distributed and 24/7 manner. Organizations can make a node under attack redundant while the rest operate as usual.  Even if a major part of the blockchain is under attack, it’ll operate as normal due to the distributed nature of the technology. Obviously, blockchains aren’t “bullet-proof.” </span>

      <span class="c15">Blockchains</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>Blockchains are shared, trusted, and public ledgers of transactions. Everyone is able to see the transactions but no single user controls them. Blockchains are cryptographed, secure, and tamper resistant. They are distributed databases that are perfect for storing information such as values, identities, agreements, property rights, and credentials. Any information placed into a blockchain will remain there forever. Blockchains are decentralized, disintermediated, affordable, and censorship resistant. Various applications include Bitcoin, Namecoin, Sia, and Ethereum.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Block</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A block is a file that is used to permanently record data. It is a record of some or all of the most recent transactions that haven’t been recorded in any previous blocks. New blocks are added at the end of the blockchain and can’t be changed or removed once they are written. Each block memorializes what happened in the minutes before it was created and keeps a record of some or all recent transactions as well as a reference to its previous block.<br/>

      <span class="c15">
        <br/>Block Explorer</span>
      <span class="c8">

      <span class="c15">Client</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A software program executed by a user on a desktop, laptop, or mobile device to launch an application.<br/>

      <span class="c15">Consensus</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A consensus requires that an agreement is made among a number of processes for a single data value.<br/>

      <span class="c15">
        <br/>Consortium Blockchains</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A consortium blockchain is a blockchain where the consensus process is controlled by a preselected set of nodes. Each user operates a node and they must sign every block for the block to be valid. The right to read the blockchain may be public or restricted to its participants. Consortium blockchains are considered to be “partially decentralized.”<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Cryptographic Hash Function</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A cryptographic hash function is a math algorithm that takes an input that can be any kind of digital data (ex: password file) and produces a single fixed length output. The main properties of cryptographic hash functions are as follows: easy to compute a hash value for any message; infeasible to generate a message from its hash function except through brute force; infeasible to change a message’s contents without changing the hash; infeasible to find two messages with the same hash; deterministic so that the same message always has the same hash output. Cryptographic hash functions may have security applications, indexing data in hash tables, fingerprinting, detecting duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect accidental data corruption.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">dApp (Decentralized Application)</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>An application is decentralized if it meets the following criteria: completely open-source, operate autonomously, and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens and all changes being decided on by a consensus of its users; data and operation records must be cryptographically stored in a public and decentralized blockchain to avoid central points of failure; must use a cryptographic token necessary for access to the application; must generate tokens according to a standard cryptographic algorithm acting as a proof of valid contributing nodes.<br/>

      <span class="c15">Hardfork</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A hardfork is a change to the protocol of the blockchain that makes previously invalid blocks or transactions valid. It requires all users to upgrade their clients.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Hashcash</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>Hashcash is a proof-of-work system that is used to limit email spam and DoS attacks. <br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Light Node</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A light node is a computer on the blockchain network that only verifies a limited number of transactions.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Lightning Network</span>
      <span class="c1">
        <br/>A lightning network is a decentralized network that uses smart contract functionality on the blockchain to allow for instant payments across a network of participants. It allows transactions to happen instantly without worrying about block confirmation times. Lightning networks also allow two participants on the network to create an entry, conduct transactions between each other, and record the state of the transactions on the blockchain.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c24">
      <span class="c15">Merkle Tree</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A Merkle tree’s main concept is to have some piece of data linking to another. This can be accomplished by linking things together via a cryptographic hash. The content itself can be used to determine the hash and this allows us to address the content. The content becomes immutable because if you change anything in the data, the hash changes and the link is different. Every block points to the previous block and a block becomes invalid if it is modified.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Node</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A node is any computer that is connected to the blockchain network. Nodes are considered to be full nodes if they fully enforce all rules of the blockchain. Most nodes are lightweight nodes but full nodes form the network backbone.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Oracles</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>Smart contracts on the blockchain that cannot access the outside network on their own. Oracles sit between a smart contract and the external world. They provide data needed by the smart contract and send its commands to external systems.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Peer-to-Peer Network</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>The decentralized interactions between two parties or more in a highly-interconnected network. Participants of a P2P network deal directly with each other through a single mediation point.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Public Address</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>The cryptographic hash of a public key. These can act as email addresses that can be published anywhere unlike private keys.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Private Keys</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>String of data that allows you to access the tokens. These act as passwords that are kept hidden from anyone but the owner of the address.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Private Blockchains</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>Private blockchains are blockchains where write permissions are centralized to a single organization. Read permissions can be public or restricted. <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">
        <br/>Proof of Authority (PoA)<br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c8">A proof of authority is a method of consensus in a private blockchain. It gives one or more clients with one particular private key the right to make all blocks on a blockchain.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Proof of Work (PoW)</span>
      <span class="c8">
        <br/>A proof of work system is a measure used to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam. PoW systems require some work from the service requester. Typical work may include processing time by a computer.<br/>
        <br/>
      </span>
      <span class="c15">Public Blockchains</span>
      <span class="c1">
        <br/>A public blockchain is a blockchain that allows for anyone to read it, send transactions, and participate in the consensus process. Public blockchains are secured by crypto economics which is the combination of economic incentives and cryptographic verification by using proof of work or proof of stake. Public blockchains are considered to be fully decentralized. <br/>
        <br/>Ring Signature<br/>Ring signatures are cryptographic and provide a decent level of anonymisation on a blockchain. They ensure that individual transaction outputs cannot be traced. A message signed with a ring signature is endorsed by someone. It should be computationally infeasible to determine which group member key was used to produce the ring signature.<br/>
        <br/>SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)<br/>A SHA is a group of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. It takes an input of any size and form, mixes it up, and creates a fixed size output known as a hash. A hash can be viewed as a fingerprint of the data. They are one-way functions and cannot be decrypted back to their original form unless brute force is used.<br/>
        <br/>Smart Contracts<br/>Smart Contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. They usually have a user interface and emulate the logic of contractual clauses. They aim to provide security superior to traditional contract law.<br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>Softfork<br/>A soft-fork is a change to the protocol where only previously valid blocks are made invalid. It is backward-compatible since old nodes will recognize new blocks as valid. This type of fork requires only a majority of miners to upgrade and enforce the new rules.<br/>
        <br/>Solidity<br/>A programming language used for developing Smart Contracts. <br/>
        <br/>SVP (Simplified Payment Verification) Client<br/>SVP Clients are lightweight clients that don’t download and locally store the entire blockchain. They provide a way to verify transactions without having to download the whole blockchain. They only download the block headers by connecting to a full node.<br/>
        <br/>State Channel<br/>A state channel is an interaction that is made off of the blockchain without significantly increasing participant risk. This is done by moving interactions off of the chain which can lead to improvements in cost and speed. They function by locking part of the blockchain state so a set of participants can completely agree with each other to update it.<br/>
        <br/>Swarm<br/>A Swarm is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service. Its primary objective is to provide a decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum’s public record. Essentially, it stores and distributes dApp code and data as well as blockchain data.<br/>
        <br/>Token<br/>A token is a digital identity for something that can be owned and is created as a sophisticated smart contract system with permission systems and interaction paths attached to them. <br/>
        <br/>Testnet<br/>A testnet is a second blockchain used by developers to test new versions of client software. This is done to prevent putting data at risk.<br/>
        <br/>Transaction Block<br/>Collection of transactions gathered into a block that can then be hashed and added into the blockchain.<br/>
        <br/>User Keys (Public and Private)<br/>Public Key: A User’s address on the blockchain. (A long string of randomly generated numbers) <br/>Private Key:  Gives access to a User’s digital assets.<br/>Having  a public and private key is what allows users to share digital assets through the blockchain safe and securely. You must safeguard and protect your private key however; and if you lose your private key you will be unable to retrieve your assets.  <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>Wallet<br/>A file that houses private keys and usually contains a software client that allows access to view and create transactions on a specific blockchain.<br/>
        <br/>Whisper<br/>A whisper is a part of the Ethereum protocol that allows for messaging between users on the same network that runs the blockchain. Its main task is the provision of a communication protocol between decentralized applications.<br/>

/*
    Quick writeup here:
    blockid is the key to the mapping, in order to access previously stored data we need to pass it the key.
    This is needed because of how we are storing the data, think of mappings like arrays, but it's a hash table instead
    This is why we need a key. 
    As for the struct, they work pretty much like you would expect, you can create mappings of them, and you can call elements with foo[key].bar
    The function addBlock is transactional, meaning it modifies storage on the contract.
    Storage is physically stored within the blockchain, unlike memory, which is temporary.
    All the getters are keyworded with "view"
    View tells the compiler these functions do not change the contract state, but do look at the state itself.
    This is the only way to return values from storage that I know of.
    I hope this helps in you understanding what is happening in this contract!
